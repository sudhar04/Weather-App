📌 Title

How I Built a Real-Time Weather App

📝 Introduction

In this project, I built a Weather App using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+) to practice working with APIs and dynamic UI updates. The goal was to create a responsive and interactive application that provides users with accurate weather information in a simple and elegant layout.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – for semantic structure and layout

CSS3 / Flexbox & Grid – for responsive and modern styling

JavaScript (ES6+) – for fetching data and adding interactivity

OpenWeatherMap API – to retrieve real-time weather data

🔨 Features

🌡️ Current Weather – Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions

📅 Forecast – Shows weather forecasts for upcoming days

🔍 City Search – Users can search for weather in any city worldwide

📱 Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

🎨 Interactive UI – Smooth animations and clear visual feedback

🧩 Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Fetching and displaying real-time data asynchronously
✅ Solution: Used JavaScript fetch API and async/await to handle API requests efficiently

Challenge: Ensuring the layout adapts to different screen sizes
✅ Solution: Implemented flexbox and CSS grid along with responsive media queries

🎯 Outcome

This project enhanced my JavaScript and API integration skills, as well as my ability to design responsive, user-friendly interfaces. It also strengthened my understanding of asynchronous programming and dynamic content rendering.
